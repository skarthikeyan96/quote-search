Also you have short legs. But... that means you have lots of character traits, right? That's all you need to know for now, don't you think? If you don't know something, we'll teach you. We're gonna make your life more fun. It doesn't matter whether we're in jail or hell. If we live happily, we win. So let's take it slow and make sure you'll enjoy tomorrow.",

All I want is to stay on target and walk straight ahead—ignoring the losses and opposition, and even the results. That’s all I can do. Some people might call it an obsession, others may deem it a miracle—but to me and many others, my driving rationale couldn’t be more obvious and natural. There are people who understand this and there are people who don’t, and I simply happen to belong to the first group. The only difference is whether they have noticed that they don’t need boxes to make their wishes come true, and what it means to fulfill a wish. My commitment to find you comes with great suffering. Not once have I thought it’s easy. For your sake, I laughed, cried, and yelled. Because of you, I destroyed my heart, my body, and the world. Still, I’m only really alive when I’m touching the fragment of you that I carry within me. Even if I don’t reach you in the end… Even if I know the horrible outcome that awaits me… I will keep searching for you, who dwells inside Maria. I’m going to vanish. Maybe I’m getting my just deserts for being too greedy with my wish. To be honest, part of me regrets that we met, but if I were to choose between a life in which we met and a life in which we didn’t, I would always pick the former. Always. I’m sure of that, even though I may be hesitating over, wavering about, and regretting my choices all the time. I will not have accomplished anything by the time I vanish, and I’m certainly not mature enough to say that I can accept that. Even now, I’m still dreaming— …that my efforts might be rewarded with some kind of happy ending.",

If we define culture as that which is healthy or humane, and defend that decision in the name of justice, once any part of that system collapses, it will cause an unimaginable number of problems for society. For instance, if I drew a line in the middle and erased one side, the next day, a new line will appear in the middle of the side that is left.

A really bothersome NEET vampire who fought to protect a human he had just met too! I've seen a lot more than just their bad sides. They're all my comrades. You know, it'd be good if you just talked about what's bothering you too. Neither humans nor vampires need reasons to want to protect or save something. If they find C3 is weakening, the balance between humans and non-humans will collapse. If we suffer major damage from Tsubaki's side and asked you all for help, can you guarantee that none of the other vampires would attack C3?

The true meaning of \"survival of the fittest\" isn't as simple as all that.",

I could hear nothing, I could bite nothing, I could smell nothing, I could feel nothing as I touch, I could not rest. I had no companion. Just walking, alone. The things reflected in my eyes have no meaning. The things that could not be reflected in my eyes do not exist. Walking walking walking walking walking walking walking walking. When I had arrived at last. I have found something extraordinary. It was somewhat the place of birth for those strange translucent objects that dotted this world. It was the first time... my eyes have been captured. With no colour, with no sound, with no scent. Does not interact with anything, it only exists there. It was the closest existence to \"void\" that I had ever laid eyes on. I sank my body... into... that great \"void\". There was nothing there,... Even I had lost my line of vision, and dissolved into the void... And felt as if everything had disappeared. Happiness. If such a thing called happiness exists in this world, it should be something which resembles the limitless nothingness. Nihility is having nothing, and having nothing to lose. If that isn't \"happiness\", then what is? The things reflected in my eyes have no meaning. The things that could not be reflected in my eyes, do not exist.

Their books will no longer exist in a hundred years. People accept this. Eternity is promised neither to humans nor to books. We live because we were born. If the system possesses the power of life and death over you... you're no longer a human. You're livestock. No matter how hard a rancher tries to pretend otherwise, they never recognize their livestock as friends. It's a mystery to me...

Actually, you shouldn't even think that you've figured out another species based on your standards. I think it's human arrogance to think we understand how other life forms feel. There may be no other life forms that are truly a \"friend\" to man. Still, even if we can't comprehend them, they are, without a doubt, neighbors deserving of our respect. We protect other species because humans themselves are lonely creatures. We protect the environment because humans themselves don't want to go extinct. What drives us is simply self-gratification. But I think that's fine, and that it's really all there is to it. There's no point in despising humans by human standards. That's right.

Although we can’t fly through the skies all alone, if we can think it, we can do almost anything. We can sleep when we’re sleepy. We are free to start or stop anything whenever we wish. Of course, it is a bit hindered by common sense, moralities, and the rules of society. Walking nude out in the streets, stealing from the elderly, and even killing, we can do all of this as long as we throw out our morals. Which is why they drill these laws in our head when we are children. And yet, people still continue to fight, deceive, and steal from each other. And so, people suffer because they live. Even now, there are events of happiness and unhappiness going on all over the world. …What can we do to make everyone happy? Of course that’s impossible for me to know. If the answer to that could be found in the shallow wisdoms of a kid, wars would have stopped long ago. But I also dislike just leaving that problem up to society or the government. After all, a great person is just one who follows the popular will of the people. In this world, the essence of a frank honest human is just an idealization. I’m sure that there’s nothing that can make everyone happy. Happiness is relative, and that’s how people want it. Evil is also relative. Mothers can become demons when they do anything to protect their child. Yet it’s usually seen as admirable. But when a person does anything for the country he loves, wars break out. Isn't it all the same thing? No matter how much a person pretends to be good and kind, he will still have negative aspects. But nobody really tries to notice that fact. Why is that? They all try to place the blame on others, and never even consider the possibility that they themselves may have played part in the problem. Just what the heck am I thinking? The world isn't going to change no matter what I think. Then what should I be doing? I don’t really want to do anything. I don’t want to order nor trouble anyone. That’s just laziness, I guess. I don’t go to school nor do I work and I've been wasting my time away since noon. Look at me, talking about the freedom of humans when I’m just some suspicious punk in this town.

Therefore, in the face of the world's wills, your personal speculations are so ephemeral they can't help being overwhelmed. Sins and punishments, destiny and judgment.

No place left for that person to gain additional knowledge or abilities. Do you know what that means? For scientists such as us, perfection only brings despair. It is our job to create things more wonderful than anything before them, but never to obtain perfection. A scientist must be a person who finds ecstasy while suffering from that antinomy.",

If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‘society’… Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all. It’s not that anyone can fulfill this role… Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the ‘losers’.

But then, if everything were taken back and it did not happen, where would all of those go? The dead people would not come back. Reality cannot be overturned. To continue on remembering the pain and the weight… isn't that how lost things remain? People will eventually die and death itself is sad, but pain shouldn't be the only thing that remains. A death is painful, but it also leaves behind bright memories. As I am bound by these people's deaths… As I am protected by my memories of Kiritsugu...

All married people prattle on about their so-called marital bliss about how they love saying \"I'm home!\" to their spouses, or how seeing their sleeping kids motivates them for tomorrow. But think about it: you can say \"I'm home!\" if you live your parents, you can even buy some mouthwash and say \"I'm home!\" to the hippos on the label. And if they're talking about seeing their sleeping kids, that just means they're working hellish overtime hours. How is that in any way blissful?",

Meaning that when those objectives are met, the war will end. That, or the war will end when the human cost outweighs the gains. Anger and hatred are only tools to tilt a war in your favor.

And the school that I was going to, it had just about the most interesting people anywhere. But that night, I realized it wasn't true. All the stuff we did during class that I thought was so fun and cool, was probably happening just like that in classes in other schools all over Japan.

But a vision that's too large creates a boundary between you and the world. It's more correct for you to recognize the large world you see as the world you live in rather than as the small space around you. But you can't feel that you're living in this big world no matter how hard you try.Your reasoning, represented by your knowledge, and your experience, respresented by your realization, will crash against each other. And eventually, you will lose yourself and confusion will begin. And then you will fall. Vision is not what your eyes see, but an image that your brain comprehends.

You weren't born with that control, were you? You had to refine it. It's the same as interacting with people. But training for that isn't in the mountains - it has to be in town where people live. Mingling with people, hurting them, getting hurt by them. That's how you learn about people and about yourself. If you don't, you'll never care about anyone but yourself. You may be a black belt fighter, but you're still a white belt in dealing with people. For the sake of the girl who will one day tell you she loves you... Don't turn away. Keep training.",

I only know things I hate about myself. 'Cause that's all I know, I hate myself. But even if you force yourself to find good things... it feels so empty. It doesn't work that way. People like your teacher just don't get it. I think... when you hear someone say they like you, for the first time... then you can begin to like yourself. I think when someone accepts you, for the first time... you feel like you can... forgive yourself a little. You can begin to face your fears... with courage.",

But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still believe that somehow...the Avatar will return to save the world.",

I spit on perfection. Perfection, after all, implies you've reached the summit. No trial and error, no ability to conceptualize. An omniscient being would have no need for such superfluous things... Am I making myself clear? For people who dabble in the sciences, such as ourselves, perfection would make us obsolete. Many magnificent things have been, and will continue to come into existence... And yet every last one of them will fall short of perfection's finish. Our function as men of science relies on their many shortcomings. Then, and only then, can we apply the fruits of our labor. To put it simply... As soon as you began spouting that nonsense about being an immaculate being... your fate was sealed. How dare you call yourself a man of science?",
